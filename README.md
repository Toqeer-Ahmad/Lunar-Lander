# Lunar-Lander
In this Capston Project we will use Deep Q-Learning with Experience Replay to train an agent to land a lunar lander safely on a landing pad on the surface of the moon.<br />

## Packages used in this project:
- numpy is a package for scientific computing in python.
- deque will be our data structure for our memory buffer.
- namedtuple will be used to store the experience tuples.
- The gym toolkit is a collection of environments that can be used to test reinforcement learning algorithms. We should note that in this notebook we are using gym version 0.24.0.
- PIL.Image and pyvirtualdisplay are needed to render the Lunar Lander environment.
- We will use several modules from the tensorflow.keras framework for building deep learning models.
- utils is a module that contains helper functions for this assignment. You do not need to modify the code in this file.
